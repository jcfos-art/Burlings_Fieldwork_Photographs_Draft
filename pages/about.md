## About the Collection

Robbins Burling was an anthropologist and sociolinguistic who conducted extensive fieldwork in India and Bangladesh. Though Burling passed away in 2021, the following collection represents some of the extent of his fieldwork, taken from never-before-seen photography of one of his field sites, the township of Rengsanggri, in Meghalaya, India from late 1996 to early 1997. 

Metadata for the photographs is scant and have been chosen to best preserve the privacy of the individuals with whom Burling worked; our hope is to pass these photographs onto the community and its descendants for proper identification of the geographic and historical context of Burling's work for posterity.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
